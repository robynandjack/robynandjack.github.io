            <h3>What to do on the island?</h3>
            <p>On Saturday, there will be ample time to do some island exploring before the wedding events begin. Helliwell Provincial Park, Tribune Bay Provincial Park, Ford's Cove Marina and Whaling Station Bay are just a few of the places where visitors can take-in Hornby Island's sea-side cliffs and sandy beaches. The island is also home to <a href="http://www.littletribunefarmandwinery.com/index.html">several</a> <a href="http://lerenavineyards.com">wineries</a>, a <a href="http://fossilbeachfarm.com/cider/">cidery</a>, a <a href="http://middlemountainmead.com">meadery</a> and a <a href="https://www.islandspirits.ca/home.html">distillery</a>, which all have tasting rooms that are typically open on Saturdays. Back at the lodge, guests are welcome to spend some time in the hot tub, which is open from 10:00 AM 'til 10:00 PM, and little ones are welcome to spend some time at the indoor and outdoor playgrounds.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://hornbyislandcoop.ca/ringside-market">ringside market</a> is the hub of the island, hosting a collection of shops, food vendors, cafes and the <a href="http://hornbyislandcoop.ca">co-op grocery store.</a> It's a 25 minute walk from Sea Breeze Lodge, or a five minute drive. Outside of summer, shops and stalls keep irregular hours, but the co-op is open seven days a week, all year round. Shoppers will find all of the daily necessities here, including a wide selection of groceries and a compact liquor store, which carries local and non-local options. A smaller store at <a href="http://www.fordscove.com/hornby%20island%20store.htm">Ford's Cove marina</a> covers most grocery items as well, and serves fresh, home-made pizza. It is open from 8:00 AM 'til 8:00 PM, seven days a week. For travelers running on fumes, the <a href="http://hornbyislandcoop.ca/gas-bar/">Gas Bar</a> serves coffee and gasoline.</p>
            <h3>What to wear?</h3>
            <p>A west-coast wedding in the fall could present all types of weather! October is usually a beautiful and clear month on the island, but temperatures are cool and there is always a chance of rain. It's recommended to bring a good jacket and a pair of waterproof shoes, as well as rain gear and gumboots if beach-side exploring is in the schedule. If the weather is clear, a warm set of clothes for evenings at the bonfire is a good idea, and a bathing suit if you plan to hot tub!</p>
            <h3>What to bring?</h3>
            <p>Each cabin should be stocked with most necessities, but it is a good idea to bring items such as a favourite coffee and creamer, snacks, and a breakfast and lunch for Saturday.  Breakfast and lunch can also be purchased at the Island's <a href="http://hornbyislandcoop.ca">grocery store</a>, or at <a href="http://www.hornbyforage.com">Forage</a>, a small restaurant that keeps off-season hours of 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.</p>
            <p>While the Hornby Island grocery store does have a good variety of alcohol, a better selection can be found while making the trip over, at the Buckley Bay gas station. Travelers are also encouraged to make time to visit the <a href="http://weinbergsgoodfood.com/">speciality food store</a> and <a href="http://www.fannybayoysters.com/location/seafood-shop">seafood market</a> next door, for some coffee, kombucha and smoked salmon.</p>
            <h3>Ferries and Travel Time</h3>
            <p>We strongly recommend that everyone reserves a ferry to and from the Lower Mainland.  While the shorter ferry routes keep an hourly winter schedule, during the off-season, the Vancouver - Nanaimo routes run every two to three hours and are likely to be backed up on Sunday evening. The trip to Hornby can be made from Vancouver in half a day. For guests traveling from outside of the Lower Mainland, a Thursday-night stay in Vancouver is recommended to avoid missing the last ferry to Hornby Island. The smaller ferries do not take reservations. Sailing times for the Buckley Bay-Denman Island route can be found <a href="https://www.bcferries.com/m/schedules/northern/vidi-current.php?scheduleSelect=sch10151903.html">here,</a> and sailing times for the Denman Island-Hornby route can be found <a href="https://www.bcferries.com/m/schedules/northern/dihi-current.php?scheduleSelect=sch10151904.html">here.</a></p>
            <h3>Kids</h3>
            <p>All weekend events are kid-friendly, plus the venue has both an outdoor playground and an indoor playroom that are available during the day. Babysitters can be booked through Sea Breeze Lodge, and we are happy to help accommodate guests who would like one for Friday night, Saturday night, or both. Please indicate in the RSVP if you are interested in booking a sitter, and we will inquire about the number of sitters needed and the cost breakdown for the parents. Private sitters for families within their cabins are also available if desired.</p>
            <h3>Dogs</h3>
            <p>Unfortunately, the wedding is a dog-free event, as Sea Breeze Lodge does not allow pets.</p>
            <h3>Gifts</h3>
            <p>Although we whole-heartedly believe that your attendance to our wedding is more than enough, if you would like to bring a gift there will be a card and gift table at the wedding reception.</p>
