            <h3>What to do on the island?</h3>
            <p>On Saturday, there will be ample time to do some island exploring before the wedding events begin. Helliwell Provincial Park, Tribune Bay Provincial Park, Ford's Cove Marina and Whaling Station Bay are just a few of the places where visitors can take-in Hornby Island's sea-side cliffs and sandy beaches. For coffee, snacks and shopping, the <a href="http://hornbyislandcoop.ca/ringside-market/">ringside market</a> is a 25 minute walk from Sea Breeze Lodge. The island is also home to <a href="http://www.littletribunefarmandwinery.com/index.html">several</a> <a href="http://lerenavineyards.com">wineries</a>, a <a href="http://fossilbeachfarm.com/cider/">cidery</a>, a <a href="http://middlemountainmead.com">meadery</a> and a <a href="https://www.islandspirits.ca/home.html">distillery</a>, which all have tasting rooms that are typically open on Saturdays. Back at the lodge, guests are welcome to spend some time in the hot tub, which is open from 10:00 AM 'til 10:00 PM, and little ones are welcome to spend some time at the indoor playground.
            <h3>What to wear?</h3>
            <p>A west-coast wedding in the fall could present all types of weather! October is ususally a beautiful and clear month on the island, but temperatures are cool and there is always a chance of rain. It's recommended to bring a good jacket and a pair of waterproof shoes, as well as rain gear and gumboots if beach-side exploring is in the schedule. If the weather is clear, a warm set of clothes for evenings at the bonfire is a good idea.</p>
            <h3>What to bring?</h3>
            <p>Each cabin should be stocked with most necessities, including towels and linens, but it is recommended to bring any uncommmon snacks and supplies for the weekend.  While the Hornby Island <a href="http://hornbyislandcoop.ca">grocery store</a> does have a good variety of alcohol, a better selection can be found at the Buckley Bay gas station, next to the ferry terminal.  Travelers are also encouraged to visit the <a href="http://weinbergsgoodfood.com/">speciality food store</a> and <a href="http://www.fannybayoysters.com/location/seafood-shop">seafood market</a> next door, for some coffee, kombucha and smoked salmon. On Saturday, breakfast and lunch can be purchased at the Island's grocery store, or at <a href="http://www.hornbyforage.com">Forage</a> restaurant, which keeps off-season hours of 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.</p>
            <h3>Ferries and Travel Time</h3>
            <p>We strongly recommend that everyone reserves a ferry to and from the Lower Mainland.  While the shorter ferry routes keep an hourly winter schedule, during the off-season, the Vancouver - Nanaimo routes run every two to three hours and are likely to be backed up on Sundary evening. The trip to Hornby can be made from Vancouver in half a day. For guests traveling from outside of the Lower Mainland, a Thursday-night stay in Vancouver is recommended to avoid missing the last ferry to Hornby Island.  Sailing times for the Buckley Bay-Denman Island route can be found <a href="https://www.bcferries.com/m/schedules/northern/vidi-current.php?scheduleSelect=sch10151903.html">here,</a> and sailing times for the Denman Island-Hornby route can be found <a href="https://www.bcferries.com/m/schedules/northern/dihi-current.php?scheduleSelect=sch10151904.html">here.</a></p>
            <h3>Gifts</h3>
            <p>Although we whole-heartedly believe that your attendence to our wedding is more than enough, if you would like to bring a gift there will be a card and gift table at the wedding reception. ...</p>
